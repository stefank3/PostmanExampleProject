# Swagger Petstore Postman Collection

This project provides a ready-to-use Postman collection for the [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/) reference API. It is organised to run automated checks in GitHub Actions with [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) and includes human-readable documentation for every test case.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or later.
* Internet access to reach `https://petstore.swagger.io`.

## Running the tests locally

Install dependencies and run the Newman test suite:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Reports generated by Newman will be written to the `reports/` directory.

## Continuous Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/newman.yml`) is provided. It installs dependencies, runs the Newman collection, and uploads the CLI output as an artifact for later inspection.

## Documentation

Detailed descriptions of every request and assertion can be found in [`docs/test-cases.md`](docs/test-cases.md).
